				Fwife : Frugalware Installer Frontend Readme

-> Fwife 0.6.2

This version only support netinstall.

-> Compiling and testing :

You have to create the configure file. Run './autogen.sh'.
Next run './configure OPTIONS'. Use './configure --help' for more details about OPTIONS.

For debugging you can use following options:
--enable-debug : Compile without NDEBUG preprocessor define
--enable-werror : compile with -Werror flag
--enable-strict : add a lot of flags and a lot of warnings ;)

Run 'make' and 'make install'. Now you can test fwife, just run fwife as root :)
To clean the directory, use 'autoclean.sh'

-> The End

Any suggestions or patchs are welcome ;)
